Hi Dudes, You can think but cannot outthink the thinking person thinking the outmost.
General Strike 1969
brightest lamps and in the howl
of a quiet rambunctious crowd
to be there and take it seriously: that is
to risk! may in the apparent
childishness crash even my
power of not giving a damn.

An innermost God could be enough
my selfishness wasn’t enough for me

wasn’t enough for these people
the taste of riches in a chocked

revenge after all. We had to
express the best: treat yourself

to a rhetoric that was howl
of protest at a fearless
destruction in our frightened
homes. (I lost it myself that
vertical love, solitary god
revolutionizing myself in people
removing myself from the sky.)

He too hanged the revolution
you’d like to be done with greatness
one good turn deserves another and with simplicity
(revised at one in the morning and with
insomnia) you destroy a shred
of what you’d like to destroy.

The bottom of the day is that one
they wanted to celebrate the
fifth anniversary of the victory
they convinced even you that you’ve gone
to drown, no one
nearby prevailed, but perished.

Dozens perished
you’ll perish the next day

if you fly,
and I baptize you the enemy of the people.

Not a simple sentence
it’s up to you to do without it
and thus undoing
that lesson in practicality you gave me
and punctual showing you that I too have
faith in reason.

Verses made in a furor of distraction
existed empty and vain in my mind
they show that in the end there was this
piece of paper.
